I am making a LOGO clone, but bakwards. So the command "forward" or "fd" is now going to be written as "drawrof" and "df". Things like "repeat" will be "taeper"

So if the user wants to draw a square in logo, they do "repeat 4 [ fd 100 rt 90]" but in my game it is "taeper 4 [ df 100 tr 90 ]"

However, I don't want anyone to know this is a logo clone, I want it to have no references to logo at all.

Can you write a "spec" document into a file named `commands.md` that outlines some comon logo commands, such as:

* movment (forward, back, left, rightt)
* pen control (penup, pendown, showturtle, hideturtle)
* repetition (repeat)
* resetting screen and position (home, clean, clearscreen)

Include things like:

* full command and short aliases
    * if no alias exists, leave out the line that is for the alias, do not make up an alias
* small example usage of each command
* any parameters or arguments needed
* any parameter/argument types

Only ever provide REAL LOGO commands, but spelt backwards. NEVER make up new ones or change existing ones.

Please make sure to output the spec in the following format:

```md
# Command Reference

[short description of what the spec contains]

## [command category 1]

- `[command name]` [any parameters or arguments]  
  Alias: `[command alias]`  
  Description: [short description of what the command does]
  Example: [an example usage of the command]

- `[command name]` [any parameters or arguments]  
  Alias: `[command alias]`  
  Description: [short description of what the command does]
  Example: [an example usage of the command]

## [command category 2]

- `[command name]` [any parameters or arguments]  
  Alias: `[command alias]`  
  Description: [short description of what the command does]
  Example: [an example usage of the command]

- `[command name]` [any parameters or arguments]  
  Alias: `[command alias]`  
  Description: [short description of what the command does]
  Example: [an example usage of the command]

```

For example, if we just take the command to jump up high (and ignoring all the other things), the output will look like this:

```md
# Command Reference

This document outlines the available commands for controlling the drawing agent.

## Movement

- **`jump`** `<height>`  
  Alias: `jp`  
  Description: The agent will jump up to a height of `<height>`
  Example: `jump 10` will make the agent jump to a height of 10 units
```
