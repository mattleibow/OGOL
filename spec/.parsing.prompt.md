Can you help me write a command parsing function that will accept the full command string and then split it up into individual commands?

Commands are defined in #file:'commands.md' 
Parsing rules are defined in #file:'command-parsing.md'

**Rules for commands**
* Each command should have its own class
* Arguments should be properties

**Rules for code**
* Please generate all the classes for all the commands
* Put all the commands in a single file
